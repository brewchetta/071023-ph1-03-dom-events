# DOM Events

## Learning Goals

- Handling click and submit events
- Event delegation and propagation
- .preventDefault()
- HTML forms

## Event Deliverables

- When someone clicks on the `X` button it "closes" the messenger by removing it from the DOM

- When the `<span>` for `File` is clicked a `console.log` happens that reads: `Hello world`

- When the `<span>` for `Profile` is hovered over a `console.log` appears that reads: `Welcome current user! We value your patronage!`

- When the `<span>` for `Help` is clicked an `alert` appears that reads: `Clippy is unavailable right now`

- *BONUS*: When the `<span>` for `Help` is clicked, instead of the above a message appears in the messages area that reads `Hi! I am clippy your office assistant. Would you like some assistance today?`

## Submit Event Deliverables

- When the `message-form` is submitted add a new `<p>` to the `messages` div with whatever was typed into the input

- *BONUS*: The new `<p>` for the message is prepended with a `<span>` that includes the timestamp and the class name `blue-text`

- *SUPER BONUS*: When a `<p>` message is clicked, remove the message from the DOM
